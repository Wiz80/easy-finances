# Security & Privacy (MVP)

- **No PII in logs**; redact or hash IDs when not required.
- Receipt images stored with **signed URLs** and short TTLs.
- Prepare for multi-tenant access patterns (row-level filters or per-tenant schemas).
- Rotate credentials; restrict DB users by role; principle of least privilege for services.
