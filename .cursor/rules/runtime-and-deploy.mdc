# Runtime & Deploy (Phase 1)

- **Single VM (Docker Compose)** services: FastAPI + LangGraph, Postgres, Redis, Qdrant, n8n, Celery worker.
- Pin images and versions; healthchecks for DB/vector store.
- Secrets only via env vars; provide `.env.example` with placeholders (no secrets).
- Expose signed URLs for receipt blobs; restrict public buckets.

## Observability
- Emit metrics: ingest latency, OCR latency, FX RTT, `% pending_confirm > 24h`, classifier confidence distribution.
