# Clarification & Confirmations Policy

- If any instruction is **ambiguous or incomplete**, **ask for clarification** before implementing.
- **Card selection**:
  - If a card is implied but unspecified, prompt user. If no response within the grace window, use **default card** and record rationale.
- **Currencies & Dates**:
  - Confirm `currency_original` when ambiguous; ensure `occurred_at` timezone aligns with **trip-scoped TZ**.
- **Destructive Actions**:
  - For data corrections that could alter money totals, require explicit confirmation and log the decision.
