# Documentation Structure & Referencing

## Structure
- Place all project docs under `docs/`:
docs/
├── context.md/ # executive-summary, business-logic, flows
├── api/ # OpenAPI, endpoint contracts, examples
├── data/ # schemas (sql), ERDs, migrations notes
├── agents/ # LangGraph design, tools, prompts
├── ops/ # deploy, compose, env samples, cost
└── qa/ # manual test drivers, checklists


## Sources of Truth
- **Business rules**: `docs/context/business-logic.md` (mirrors *Project Context* rule).
- **Schemas**: `docs/data/schemas.sql` + `docs/data/er-diagram.md`.
- **API**: `docs/api/openapi.yaml` + `docs/api/examples/*.md`.

## Referencing from Cursor
- When you need context, reference with `@` in prompts/rules (e.g., `@docs/api/openapi.yaml`).  
- Keep docs concise and **updated in English**; user-facing copy in apps can be localized.

## Acceptance
- Any change to the data model or FX policy **must** update the docs before merge.
